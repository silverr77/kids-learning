# Apple App Review Response - Version 1.4.0

## Guideline 2.3.8 - Performance - Accurate Metadata

### Response:
We have updated our app name to **"تحدي - درب عقلك"** (Challenge - Train Your Mind), which no longer implies that the app is made specifically for children. The new app name is a general educational app name that does not indicate the app is exclusively for children. The app is an educational learning app that can be used by users of various ages, and we have ensured that our app name, subtitle, icon, and screenshots do not specifically target children as the main audience.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ Updated app name to "تحدي - درب عقلك" in App Store Connect
- ✅ Verified that app name, subtitle, icon, and screenshots do not imply the app is exclusively for children

This progression system is completely free and does not involve any purchases. Users unlock new levels and games by earning achievements through normal app usage, not through payment.
